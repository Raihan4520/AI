## Overview

Throughout the AI course, I implemented several key algorithms and concepts that form the foundation of artificial intelligence. These codes include various classical AI techniques and machine learning approaches, which were part of the course curriculum.

The code in this repository demonstrates how core AI principles were applied to solve specific problems or exercises given during the course.

## Course Topics Covered

1. **Search Algorithms**  
   - Implementation of classical search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A*.
   - Focused on graph traversal, pathfinding, and heuristic-based search.

2. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**  
   - Solving constraint satisfaction problems such as the N-Queens problem using backtracking and forward checking techniques.

3. **Machine Learning Algorithms**  
   - Implementations of basic machine learning algorithms including:
     - **Decision Trees**
     - **Naive Bayes**
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Practical exploration of supervised learning techniques.

4. **Game Playing Algorithms**  
   - Using the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning for decision-making in turn-based games like Tic-Tac-Toe.

5. **Basic Neural Networks**  
   - Constructing simple neural networks from scratch for basic classification tasks using backpropagation.

6. **Other AI Techniques**  
   - Exploration of additional AI-related algorithms and concepts such as optimization, probabilistic reasoning, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** 
  - NumPy (for numerical computation)
  - scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
  - Matplotlib (for visualizing data and results)
